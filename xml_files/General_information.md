DESCRIPTION
----------

1. Dataset language:
Catalan and Spanish


2. Abstract:

Parliamentary speeches are considered to be of interest for different
research areas because they are publicly available transcriptions, produced under
controlled and regulated procedures that add totally reliable sociodemographic data
like gender, age, and other details of the speakers. Moreover, speeches are rich
in topics and domains, and they are actually public domain data, not subject to
copyright restrictions. The ParlaMint project: Towards Comparable Parliamentary
Corpora is developing a comparable and uniformly annotated multilingual corpus
with the data from 33 different parliaments in Europe. In the paper we described the
details of building the ParlaMintCAT corpus, for which the transcriptions of the
Catalan Parliament General Assembly sessions from 2015 to 2022 have been compiled,
processed and annotated.
